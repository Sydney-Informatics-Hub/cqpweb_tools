1. Rearrange the corpus files so that the texts are in the order specified in the spreadsheet - see data/original_ids.csv for the original text IDs and the order which they should be occuring according to the spreadsheet
2. Reindex the corpus on a local version of the CQPweb stack
3. Test the reindexed corpus with a bunch of searches compared against the current live CQPWeb
4. Reindex the CQPweb version
